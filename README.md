# Atlamillia Engine
A C++ isometric game engine using SDL2, built primarily as a successor to the Atla engine (see [here](https://github.com/SLynchy/SlimesFromOuterSpace)) with enhancements to the AI engine and state management, as well as overall engine design improvements and optimizations.

# Installation
Create a project with SDL2 and GLM configured/included, then simply include "Atlamillia.h". Refer to the sample for guidance.
